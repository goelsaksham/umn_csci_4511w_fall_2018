This sample uses much more than the required 3 papers. If you only have 3 papers you must do a much more descriptive analysis of them.

If you choose to cover more papers (like shown), you can group them together and spend more time on their connected (or different) focuses rather than individual summaries.

You can use your citations in the following ways (assume [2] is about A*):
1) A noun. Example: "In [2] the A* algorithm is presented."
2) At the end of sentence involving the paper. Example: "A* is shown to greately reduce the branching factor [2]."
3) After the name(s) of the author(s) or subject in the sentence. Example: "Fake Name [2] show how A* always outperforms uniform cost search." Example 2: "Using heuristics, A* [2] can outperform uniform cost search."
4) Similar to 3, a list of related papers to an author or subject. Example: "Search techniques ([2], [3], [7]) are a popular way to solve N-Queens."
